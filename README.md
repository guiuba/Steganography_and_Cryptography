# Steganography_and_Cryptography
This program asks for a message and a password. Then encrypts and conceals the message in an image.  It shows back the message, if the password is correct : )

Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: Encrypting and decrypting a message.

Task (hide, show, exit):
> hide
Input image file:
> travel.png
Output image file:
> enc.png
Message to hide:
> My encrypted message!
Password:
> mypassword
Message saved in enc.png image.
Task (hide, show, exit):
> show
Input image file:
> enc.png
Password:
> mypassword
Message:
My encrypted message!
Task (hide, show, exit):
> exit
Bye!
Example 2: Encrypting a message in a very small image.

Task (hide, show, exit):
> hide
Input image file:
> small.png
Output image file:
> out2.png
Message to hide:
> abcdefghijk
Password:
> mypassword
The input image is not large enough to hold this message.
Task (hide, show, exit):
> exit
Bye!
